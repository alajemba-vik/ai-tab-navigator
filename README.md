# AI Tab Navigator: A Tab Hoarder's Best Friend

## The Story Behind the Extension

As a student, my biggest shame is that I can never seem to control my tabs. First, I start off with one tab in a clean blank window...zen..but then it easily fills up with 2, 3, 4 and many more tabs than i can count. When I realized that I had officially become a **tab-hoarder**, it was crucial that I seek solutions before I drown in this chaos. Instead of closing my tabs like a sane person would, I decided to create AI tab navigator.

## What exactly is AI Tab Navigator?
It is a Chrome extension that relies on Chrome's built-in AI APIs to help tab-hoaders around the world (who speak English) to search for tabs using natural language. Let's see it in action:

## What Problems does AI Tab Navigator solve?

Traditional tab management doesn't work:
- **Browser search** only finds tabs by title (useless when you have 20 tabs with "Anime" in the name or you just don't remember the title)
- **Tab groups** require manual organization (who has time for that?)
- **Bookmarks** become another graveyard of links you'll never revisit
- **Close all tabs?** Too scary. What if you need one of them?

Sometimes, what we need is a tool that accepts our chaos just rolls with it.

## How does AI Tab Navigator solve these problems?

### 🔍 **Smart Search That Actually Works**
- Search by content, not just titles
- Find that one tab about "neural networks" even if the title says "TensorFlow Documentation"
- AI understands context and relevance, not just keyword matching

### 🤖 **On-Device AI Analysis**
- Uses Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano AI (completely private and offline)
- Analyzes tab content to understand what each page is actually about
- Ranks results by true relevance, not just word matching

### ⚡ **Hybrid Search**
- Keyword search returns quick results
- AI enhancement adds better matches in the background
- Best of both worlds: speed + intelligence

### 📊 **Smart Result Management**
- See exactly WHY each tab matches your search (with quoted evidence)
- Automatically create groups for all matching tabs with a single click

### 📜 **Search History**
- Automatically saves your last 5 searches
- Click any recent search to re-run that search
- Never lose track of what you were looking for

### 🎯 **Tab Summaries On Demand**
- View AI-generated summaries of your tabs
- Understand what's on a tab without opening it
- Perfect for deciding which tabs to keep or close

### The Technical Magic

The extension uses a three-stage AI verification process to prevent hallucinations:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Does this tab relate to the query?
2. **Challenge Reasoning**: WHY does it match? What specific text proves it?
3. **Prove It**: Go back to the data and quote the exact evidence

This ensures the AI never makes up matches - it must prove every result with quoted text from the actual tab.


## For My Fellow Students

If you're a student who:
- Has 30+ tabs open right now
- Promises yourself you'll "organize them later"
- Loses important research tabs in the sea of YouTube videos or tutorial articles 
- Has separate browser windows for each class/project that somehow all bleed together

Then this is for you. Welcome to the tab-hoarder support group. We don't close tabs here, we just look for ways to find them. 😎

**AI Tab Navigator** - Because life's too short to manually organize tabs, and too busy to lose important ones.
