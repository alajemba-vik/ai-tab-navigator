# AI Tab Navigator - YouTube Demo Script

## Hook (0:00-0:15)
"As a student, my biggest shame is that I can never seem to control my tabs. First, I start off with one tab in a clean blank window...zen...but then it easily fills up with 2, 3, 4 and many more tabs than I can count. When I realized I had officially become a tab-hoarder, I decided to do something about it."

## Problem Setup (0:15-0:30)
"Instead of closing my tabs like a sane person would, I built AI Tab Navigator. Because Chrome's tab search only works if you remember the exact title - and who actually remembers that?"

## Solution Intro (0:30-0:45)
"This extension understands what you're actually looking for, not just keyword matches. It uses Chrome's built-in AI to search through your tabs like you think."

## Demo 1: Natural Language Search (0:40-1:10)
**Action:** Type "email about medium"
**Say:** "I can search like I think. 'Email about medium' - and it finds tabs about Medium.com emails, not just any tab with the word 'email.'"
**Show:** Results with AI reasoning displayed

## Demo 2: Semantic Understanding (1:10-1:40)
**Action:** Type "best food to try"
**Say:** "It gets context. Search for 'food' and it'll match that ice cream recipe tab - because ice cream IS food. But it won't match random stuff like 'food for thought.'"
**Show:** Relevance scores and quoted evidence

## Demo 3: Tab Summaries (1:40-2:00)
**Action:** Click three-dot menu → View Summary
**Say:** "Plus, it generates summaries for every tab. Click any result and see what the page is actually about without switching to it."
**Show:** Summary dropdown appearing

## Privacy Point (2:00-2:15)
**Say:** "And here's the best part - it all runs on your device using Chrome's built-in AI. No data leaves your machine. Ever."

## Close (2:15-2:30)
**Say:** "It's free, open source, and available now on the Chrome Web Store. Link in description. Stop closing tabs - start finding them."

**Final frame:** Extension name + link

## Tips for Recording:
- Keep energy high - you're solving a real problem
- Show actual messy tabs (not staged ones)
- Emphasize the AI reasoning quotes - that's the unique feature
- Record in 1080p, keep it under 2:30 minutes
- Use smooth mouse movements during demos
- Consider showing the "creative but wrong" matches you fixed (for engagement)

## Possible B-Roll:
- Scrolling through tons of tabs (relatable pain point)
- Close-up of AI reasoning text
- Quick montage of different searches working
- Code snippets from your implementation (technical credibility)
